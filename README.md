## Overview
This documentation provides guidance on implementing access tokens and refresh tokens in a Node.js project using JWT, bcrypt, and Joi. Access tokens and refresh tokens are used to authenticate and authorize users in web applications.

## Requirements
To implement access tokens and refresh tokens in your Node.js project, you'll need the following:

Node.js installed on your machine
A package manager like npm or yarn
The following dependencies:
jsonwebtoken
bcrypt
joi

## Getting Started
To get started, create a new Node.js project using your preferred package manager. Once you've created your project, install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

```
git clone url
cd server
npm install jsonwebtoken bcrypt joi

```
